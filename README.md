### PDX IoT Meetup notes (17-Dec-2015)

#### Chris Daly

- Have been an IoT hobbyist / enthusiast for several years
- Day job as software engineer, but not in IoT
- Some of my favorite things about IoT:
  - Find interesting/cool parts (Sparkfun, Adafruit, SeeedStudio, Kickstarter(tech), etc.)
  - Assemble them into working systems (remember building PCs from parts?)
  - Write custom software for the systems (use/adapt lots of existing software too)

**Problem:** Systems cluttering up desk and table space.

**Solution:** Wall hanging systems!

**Problem:** Ugly systems on the wall.

**Solution(?):** Design systems as wall hanging artworks(?!?!)
