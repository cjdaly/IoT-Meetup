### PDX IoT Meetup notes (17-Dec-2015)

#### Chris Daly

- have been an IoT hobbyist / enthusiast for several years
- day job as software engineer, but not in IoT
- some of my favorite things about IoT:
  - find interesting/cool parts (Sparkfun, Adafruit, SeeedStudio, Kickstarter(tech), etc.)
  - assemble them into working systems (remember building PCs from parts?)
  - write custom software for the systems (use/adapt lots of existing software too)

**Problem:** (too many) Things cluttering up desk and table space.

**Solution:** Wall hanging Things!

**Problem:** Ugly Things on the wall.

**Solution(?):** Design Things as wall hanging artworks(!)
